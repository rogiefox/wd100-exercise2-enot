    <h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>
    <p>
        Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.
    </p>
    <p>
        The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see <a href="" style="color: blue;">copyright</a> ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive files (.tar.Z). To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-
    </p>
    <xmp>                        > ftp info.cern.ch
                        Enter user name: anonymous
                        Password: me@myhost.edu
                        ftp> cd /pub/www/src
                        ftp> binary
                        ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
                        ftp> quit
                        ></xmp> 
    <p>
        The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.
    </p>
    <xmp>                        uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z </xmp> 
    <p>
        This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it,
    </p>
    <xmp>                        tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar </xmp>   
    <p>
        Now you should <a href="" style="color: blue;">install the line mode browser</a> , <a href="" style="color: blue;">install the server</a> , <a href="" style="color: blue;">install Viola</a>, etc.<br>
