    <h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
    <p>
        A <a href="">W3</a> server, like the ftp <a href="" style="color: blue;">daemon</a> , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data. 
    </p>
    <h2>The basic daemon</h2>
    <p>
        The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:

        <li><a href="" style="color: blue;">Internals</a>-- a description of the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:

    <h2>Making a new server</h2>
    <p>
        This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:

        <li><a href="" style="color: blue;">Writing a server as a script</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.
    </p>
    <h2>Other servers and Gateways</h2>
    <p>
        These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.
